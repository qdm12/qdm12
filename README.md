## Open source projects

Lazy here, see my Github 😄

But there are multiple 1M+ downloads Docker images I made, mostly in Go.

## Pickiness

I'm picky because I want my development experience to be 🌞 and not 🌧

- I want a Linux OS for my work computer, Arch based ideally. No Windows and please no OSX at all.
- 🐳 I develop in Docker containers (literally, except Flutter for now), that's why Linux native performance is great
- ❤️ Postgresql, Kubernetes, Docker, Grafana, Prometheus, Redis, Arch Linux, ZFS/BTRFS, SVGs & Inkscape, REST, GraphQL, GCP, VSCode, Drone CI
- 🤔 I know a little and am curious about Rust, Hadoop/Pig/Hive/Impala, Ethereum Solidity, OpenCL/Cuda
- I know but don't want to use: Java/C# 👹, C++, Python, Nodejs, Scala, OSX, JQuery, Phonegap, Vagrant, Jenkins

## Other

- I 🗣 French and English
- I have 3 nationalities
- I studied some managerial courses: corporate finance, economics, UK accouting, project management, innovation management and entrepreneurship
- I got some Sololearn certificates ~~*I obtained during my 🚽 time*~~
  - [Javascript](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/1024-7022047/pdf/?mode=download)
  - [Java](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/1068-7022047/pdf/?mode=download)
  - [SQL](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/1060-7022047/pdf/?mode=download)
  - [JQuery](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/1082-7022047/pdf/?mode=download)
